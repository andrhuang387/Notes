Task: Find the smallest element in every subarray

- let range be size k 
- Use a dequeue (so that you can change the front and back)
- if current value is smaller, then delete until none or top is smaller (the first element should be smallest element)
 - once i >=k, if the current smallest element is shifted out of the window, remove it
 
 Note:Can be modified to sliding window maximum by shifting the <= sign to >=
