Task: find minimum value of a subarray


Intuition: every nonnegative number can be represented as binary, so ranges can be done the same way
-Find the minimum of subarrays of powers of two
- For each query, represent as binary
 - for each binary 1, find the precomputed minimum query
 - solution is the minimum of all 2^i queries
