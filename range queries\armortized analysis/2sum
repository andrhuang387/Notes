1. binary search
 - you can binary search by sorting the elements, iterate over every element, and binary search
 - if the value equals the current element, check neighbors to see if it works
 
 
 2. walk in method
  - sort the elements
  -have two pointers on leftmost and rightmost
  - if sum is too small, push the left on in
  - if the sum is too large, push the right one in
  - continue until no more to push in or found
